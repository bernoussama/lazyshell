# Scratchpad

This file tracks the current implementation tasks and progress for the CLAI-TS project.

## Current Active Task

**âœ… COMPLETED: Add Configuration File Feature** - [config-file-feature.md](implementation-plan/config-file-feature.md)

## Lessons Learned

- [2024-05-23] Configuration feature implementation:
  - Using `@clack/prompts` provides excellent UX for interactive setup
  - Storing config in `~/.lazyshell/config.json` works well for persistence
  - Fallback to environment variables ensures backwards compatibility
  - TypeScript interfaces help maintain code quality and type safety
  - Modular design allows easy extension for future providers
  - Comprehensive documentation is essential for user adoption
