```bash
lazyshell -s "find all JavaScript files"  # No explanation, just the command
lsh --silent "show disk usage"            # Same with long flag
```

### Examples
```bash
# Find files
lazyshell "find all JavaScript files modified in the last 7 days"

# System monitoring  
lazyshell "show disk usage sorted by size"

# Process management
lazyshell "find all running node processes"

# Docker operations
lazyshell "list all docker containers with their memory usage"

# File operations
lazyshell "compress all .log files in this directory"

# Package management (system-aware)
lazyshell "install docker"  # Uses apt/yum/pacman/etc based on your distro
```

### Interactive Features
- **Execute**: Run the generated command immediately
- **Refine**: Modify your prompt to get a better command
- **Cancel**: Exit without running anything
- **Clipboard**: Commands are automatically copied for manual execution

## System Intelligence 🧠

LazyShell automatically detects your system environment:

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Linux Distribution**: Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.
- **Package Manager**: apt, yum, dnf, pacman, zypper, etc.
- **Shell**: bash, zsh, fish, etc.
- **Current Directory**: Provides context for relative paths

This enables LazyShell to generate system-appropriate commands and suggest the right package manager for installations.

## Evaluation System 🧪

LazyShell includes a flexible evaluation system for testing and benchmarking AI performance:

```typescript
import { runEval, Levenshtein, LLMJudge, createLLMJudge } from './lib/eval';

await runEval("My Eval", {
  // Test data function
  data: async () => {
    return [{ input: "Hello", expected: "Hello World!" }];
  },
  // Task to perform  
  task: async (input) => {
    return input + " World!";
  },
  // Scoring methods
  scorers: [Levenshtein, LLMJudge],
});
```

### Built-in Scorers
- **ExactMatch**: Perfect string matching
- **Levenshtein**: Edit distance similarity  
- **Contains**: Substring matching
- **LLMJudge**: AI-powered quality evaluation
- **createLLMJudge**: Custom AI judges with specific criteria

### LLM Judge Features
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: Uses LLMs to evaluate command quality without expected outputs
- **Multiple Criteria**: Quality, correctness, security, efficiency assessments
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in retry logic and exponential backoff
- **Configurable Models**: Use different AI models for judging

### Features
- Generic TypeScript interfaces for any evaluation task
- Multiple scoring methods per evaluation
- Async support for LLM-based tasks
- Detailed scoring reports with averages
- Error handling for failed test cases

See [docs/EVALUATION.md](docs/EVALUATION.md) for complete documentation.

## Model Benchmarking 🏆

LazyShell includes comprehensive benchmarking capabilities to compare AI model performance:

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
# Build and run benchmarks
pnpm build
node dist/bench_models.mjs
```

### Benchmark Features
- **Multi-Model Testing**: Compare Groq, Gemini, Ollama, Mistral, and OpenRouter models
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, success rate, and output quality
- **Standardized Prompts**: Consistent test cases across all models
- **JSON Reports**: Detailed results saved to `benchmark-results/` directory

### Available Models
- `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (Groq)
- `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` (Google)
- `devstral-small-2505` (Mistral)
- `ollama3.2` (Ollama)
- `or-devstral` (OpenRouter)

## CI Evaluations 🚦

LazyShell includes automated quality assessments that run in CI to ensure consistent performance:

### Overview
- **Automated Testing**: Runs on every PR and push to main/develop
- **Threshold-Based**: Configurable quality thresholds that must be met
- **LLM Judges**: Uses AI to evaluate command quality, correctness, security, and efficiency
- **GitHub Actions**: Integrated with CI/CD pipeline

### Quick Setup
1. Add `GROQ_API_KEY` to your GitHub repository secrets
2. Evaluations run automatically with 70% threshold by default
3. CI fails if quality scores drop below the threshold

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run CI evaluations locally
pnpm eval:ci
```

### Custom Evaluation Scripts
```bash
# Run basic evaluations
pnpm build && node dist/lib/basic.eval.mjs

# Run LLM judge evaluation
pnpm build && node dist/lib/llm-judge.eval.mjs

# Test AI library
pnpm build && node dist/test-ai-lib.mjs

# Run example evaluations
pnpm build && node dist/lib/example.eval.mjs
```

See [docs/CI_EVALUATIONS.md](docs/CI_EVALUATIONS.md) for complete setup and configuration guide.

### Development Features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and modern JavaScript features
- **pkgroll**: Modern bundling with tree-shaking
- **jiti**: Fast development with TypeScript execution
- **Watch Mode**: Auto-compilation during development
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **ESM**: Modern ES modules throughout

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Configuration Issues
- **Invalid configuration**: Delete `~/.lazyshell/config.json` to reset or use `lazyshell config`
- **API key errors**: Run `lazyshell config` to re-enter your API key
- **Provider not working**: Try switching to a different provider in the configuration

### Environment Variables
LazyShell will automatically fall back to environment variables if the config file is invalid or incomplete.

### Common Issues
- **Clipboard not working**: Ensure your system supports clipboard operations
- **Model timeout**: Some models (especially Ollama) may take longer to respond
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in retry logic handles temporary rate limits
- **Command not found**: Make sure the package is properly installed globally

### Debug Mode
For troubleshooting, you can check:
- Configuration file: `~/.lazyshell/config.json`
- System detection: The AI considers your OS, distro, and package manager
- Command history: Generated commands are added to your shell history
